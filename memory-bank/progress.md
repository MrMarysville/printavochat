# Progress: Printavo Chat Application

**Completed:**
- ✅ Initial project setup and file structure.
- ✅ Created core memory bank documentation:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
- ✅ Enhanced API route in `app/api/printavo/route.ts` with better error handling and request validation.
- ✅ Added and verified functionality for querying orders by Visual ID:
    - Updated `printavo-service.ts` to properly use `getOrderByVisualId` from `graphql-client.ts`.
    - Refined `operations.ts` to handle Visual ID query as a first attempt when a 4-digit number is detected.
    - Improved error handling for different query attempt scenarios.
- ✅ Enhanced natural language processing for Visual ID queries:
    - Added pattern matching for explicit Visual ID references (e.g., "visual ID 1234")
    - Implemented support for compound queries like "find order with visual ID 1234"
    - Updated help command to guide users on using Visual ID search
- ✅ Implemented customer creation functionality:
    - Added `CustomerCreateInput` interface to `types.ts`
    - Added `createCustomer` mutation and methods to `graphql-client.ts`
    - Created customer creation methods in `printavo-service.ts`
    - Added natural language customer creation detection in `operations.ts`
    - Enhanced help command to include customer creation option
- ✅ Created `.clinerules` file to document important project patterns and knowledge.
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive error handling system:
    - Created specific error classes (Authentication, Validation, NotFound, RateLimit)
    - Updated API routes to use consistent error handling patterns
    - Added input validation to service methods
    - Standardized error response format across all endpoints
- ✅ Implemented caching mechanism for improved performance:
    - Created `lib/cache.ts` with in-memory cache and TTL support
    - Added caching to key GraphQL operations (getOrder, getOrderByVisualId, searchOrders)
    - Implemented automatic cleanup of expired cache items
    - Created unit tests for the cache implementation
- ✅ Improved Visual ID search implementation:
    - Created detailed documentation in `cline_docs/printavoApiDocs/visual_id_search.md`
    - Updated GraphQL queries to use documented API endpoints (invoices) instead of undocumented ones (orders)
    - Enhanced `getOrderByVisualId` function to properly handle the response structure from the invoices endpoint
    - Implemented a multi-tiered approach in `searchOrders` to try documented endpoints first
    - Fixed TypeScript errors and ensured parameter consistency across all files
    - Improved error handling and logging for better diagnostics

**To Do:**
- **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for new functionality.
    - Test visual ID query feature with the updated implementation.
    - Test stability improvements.
- **UI Improvements:**
    - Consider enhancing the chat interface to better communicate Visual ID capabilities.
    - Add visual feedback when a Visual ID is detected in user input.
- **Additional Features:**
    - Implement quotes endpoint as a fallback for the invoices endpoint.
    - Add support for more complex Visual ID queries.
    - Consider adding a filter by Visual ID feature to the order search functionality.

**Current Status:**
- Core visual ID query functionality is implemented and operational.
- API route and supporting service functions have improved error handling.
- Error handling has been standardized across the application with specific error types.
- Caching mechanism implemented for improved performance of GraphQL operations.
- Memory bank documentation is comprehensive.
- Visual ID search now uses documented API endpoints for better reliability.

**Known Issues:**
- Type validation warnings that we've addressed with type assertions, but might warrant a cleaner solution in the future.
- The GraphQL queries might need to be updated if the Printavo API changes its structure.

**Next Steps:**
- Test the implementation thoroughly with various Visual ID scenarios.
- Consider UI improvements to better communicate Visual ID capabilities to users.
- Explore adding a filter by Visual ID feature to the order search functionality.
- Implement the quotes endpoint as an additional fallback for the invoices endpoint.

**Notes:**
- The Visual ID query feature now prioritizes searching by Visual ID when a 4-digit number is detected.
- Error handling has been significantly improved with:
    - Custom error classes for different error types (Authentication, Validation, NotFound, RateLimit)
    - Consistent error response format across all API routes
    - Better logging with the logger utility
    - Proper input validation in service methods
    - Appropriate HTTP status codes for different error types
    - User-friendly error messages based on error type
- The types for querying customers could be improved to better support search functionality.
- Caching has been implemented with the following features:
    - In-memory cache with TTL (Time To Live) to prevent stale data
    - Cache implemented for getOrder, getOrderByVisualId, and searchOrders functions
    - Different TTL values for different types of data (5 minutes for order details, 2 minutes for search results)
    - Automatic cleanup of expired cache items
    - Unit tests for the cache implementation
- Visual ID search implementation has been improved with:
    - Use of documented API endpoints (invoices) instead of undocumented ones (orders)
    - Better fallback mechanisms for reliability
    - Consistent parameter naming across all files
    - Detailed documentation for future developers
