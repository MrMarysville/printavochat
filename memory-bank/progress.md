# Progress: Printavo Chat Application

**Completed:**
- Initial project setup and file structure.
- Created core memory bank documentation:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
- Enhanced API route in `app/api/printavo/route.ts` with better error handling and request validation.
- Added and verified functionality for querying orders by Visual ID:
    - Updated `printavo-service.ts` to properly use `getOrderByVisualId` from `graphql-client.ts`.
    - Refined `operations.ts` to handle Visual ID query as a first attempt when a 4-digit number is detected.
    - Improved error handling for different query attempt scenarios.
- Enhanced natural language processing for Visual ID queries:
    - Added pattern matching for explicit Visual ID references (e.g., "visual ID 1234")
    - Implemented support for compound queries like "find order with visual ID 1234"
    - Updated help command to guide users on using Visual ID search
- Implemented customer creation functionality:
    - Added `CustomerCreateInput` interface to `types.ts`
    - Added `createCustomer` mutation and methods to `graphql-client.ts`
    - Created customer creation methods in `printavo-service.ts`
    - Added natural language customer creation detection in `operations.ts`
    - Enhanced help command to include customer creation option
- Created `.clinerules` file to document important project patterns and knowledge.

**To Do:**
- **Additional Stability Improvements:**
    - Further review codebase for other potential error scenarios.
    - Implement more robust data validation where needed.
    - Consider adding caching mechanisms to improve performance.
- **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for new functionality.
    - Test visual ID query feature.
    - Test stability improvements.

**Current Status:**
- Core visual ID query functionality is implemented and operational.
- API route and supporting service functions have improved error handling.
- Memory bank documentation is comprehensive.

**Known Issues:**
- Type validation warnings that we've addressed with type assertions, but might warrant a cleaner solution in the future.

**Next Steps:**
- Test the implementation thoroughly with various Visual ID scenarios.
- Consider UI improvements to better communicate Visual ID capabilities to users.
- Explore adding a filter by Visual ID feature to the order search functionality.

**Notes:**
- The Visual ID query feature now prioritizes searching by Visual ID when a 4-digit number is detected.
- Error handling has been improved to provide more meaningful error messages.
- The types for querying customers could be improved to better support search functionality.
