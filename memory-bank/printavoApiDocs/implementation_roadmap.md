# Printavo Chat Application Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines a step-by-step plan for addressing the issues identified in the Printavo Chat application. The roadmap is organized into phases to ensure a systematic approach to resolving the problems.

## Phase 1: Code Organization and Structure

### Step 1: Consolidate GraphQL Operations
- [ ] Review all GraphQL operations across the codebase
- [ ] Move all operation exports to `lib/graphql-client.ts`
- [ ] Update imports in dependent files
- [ ] Remove duplicate exports

### Step 2: Resolve Duplicate Query Definitions
- [ ] Compare queries in `lib/graphql/queries.ts` and `lib/graphql/queries/orderQueries.ts`
- [ ] Consolidate into a single source of truth
- [ ] Update imports in dependent files
- [ ] Add comments to document the purpose of each query

### Step 3: Define Clear Responsibility Boundaries
- [ ] Document the role of each key file:
  - [ ] `lib/graphql-client.ts`: Entry point for all GraphQL operations
  - [ ] `lib/printavo-api.ts`: Low-level API interactions
  - [ ] `lib/operations.ts`: Business logic for user operations
  - [ ] `lib/printavo-service.ts`: Simplified interface for the application
- [ ] Update code organization to reflect these boundaries

## Phase 2: API Alignment and Implementation

### Step 4: Align GraphQL Queries with API Documentation
- [ ] Compare each query with the Printavo API documentation in `results.json`
- [ ] Update field names and parameters to match the API
- [ ] Add missing fields that are available in the API
- [ ] Remove fields that are not supported by the API

### Step 5: Implement Complete Visual ID Search Strategy
- [ ] Update `getOrderByVisualId` to follow the multi-tiered approach in documentation
- [ ] Add fallback to `quotes` endpoint when `invoices` endpoint returns no results
- [ ] Ensure consistent inclusion of `visualId` field in all relevant queries
- [ ] Add proper error handling for each step in the search process

### Step 6: Implement Missing Operations
- [ ] Identify all placeholder functions in `lib/graphql/operations.ts`
- [ ] Prioritize implementation based on application requirements
- [ ] Implement high-priority operations first:
  - [ ] `createTask`
  - [ ] `createPaymentRequest`
  - [ ] `createFee`
  - [ ] `updateFee`
  - [ ] `deleteFee`
- [ ] Document any operations that cannot be implemented due to API limitations

## Phase 3: Error Handling and Service Layer

### Step 7: Standardize Error Handling
- [ ] Review all error handling across the codebase
- [ ] Create a standard error handling pattern
- [ ] Update all operations to use the standard pattern
- [ ] Ensure proper use of custom error classes:
  - [ ] `PrintavoAuthenticationError`
  - [ ] `PrintavoValidationError`
  - [ ] `PrintavoNotFoundError`
  - [ ] `PrintavoRateLimitError`

### Step 8: Simplify Service Layer
- [ ] Review all methods in `printavo-service.ts`
- [ ] Identify redundant fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Consolidate multiple paths for similar functionality
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling and response formats

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

### Step 9: Add Unit Tests
- [ ] Add tests for GraphQL operations
- [ ] Add tests for error handling
- [ ] Add tests for Visual ID search strategy
- [ ] Add tests for service layer methods

### Step 10: Update Documentation
- [ ] Update code comments to reflect changes
- [ ] Update README and other documentation
- [ ] Document any known limitations or issues
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 days | None |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 days | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | 1-2 days | Phase 2 |
| Phase 4 | 1-2 days | Phase 3 |

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to addressing the issues identified in the Printavo Chat application. By following these steps, the application will be better aligned with the intended architecture, more maintainable, and more reliable.

Progress on this roadmap should be tracked in the project management system, with regular updates on completed steps and any challenges encountered.
