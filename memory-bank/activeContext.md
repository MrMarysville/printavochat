**Current Implementation:**

- **Visual ID Query:** The system now supports simpler "find order XXXX" queries in addition to more explicit formats. This makes it more intuitive for users to find orders.
- **Quote Creation via Chat:** Users can now create quotes entirely through conversation, with the system guiding them through the process of adding customer details, line items, and notes.
- **Enhanced Quote Editing:** The quote creation workflow now supports:
  - Editing existing line items with "edit item N: [details]" commands
  - Removing items from the quote with "remove item N" commands
  - Previewing the current state of the quote with "preview quote" command
  - Improved validation and error handling throughout the process
- **Order Details Display:** The OrderCard component now shows comprehensive information including line items, customer details, notes, and addresses with improved styling.
- **Orders Page:** Enhanced with pagination, search functionality, status filtering, and improved mobile responsiveness.
- **Live Data Integration:** All parts of the application (homepage, dashboard, and chat) now consistently use live data from the Printavo API.
- **Error Handling:** Improved error handling with custom error classes and detailed error messages. All API routes now use consistent error handling patterns.
- **Service Layer:** The `printavo-service.ts` now properly uses operations from `graphql-client.ts`, making the code more maintainable.
- **API Routes:** The API route in `app/api/printavo/route.ts` now includes better parameter validation and specific handling for visual ID queries.
- **Dashboard:** Enhanced with real-time data updates, interactive charts for sales trends, revenue tracking, and customizable sort order for orders display. By default, orders are sorted from newest to oldest for quick access to most recent activity.
- **API Rate Limiting:** Implemented robust handling of API rate limits with exponential backoff, intelligent retries, and detailed user feedback.
- **Error Boundary:** Enhanced error boundary component with API-specific error handling, retry functionality, and detailed error information.
- **Skeleton Loaders:** Implemented skeleton loaders for improved loading states throughout the application, with specialized components for orders, charts, and dashboards.
- **Global Search:** Added global search functionality with support for searching orders and customers, with visual ID prioritization and intelligent relevance sorting.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

- **Type Definitions:** We've improved type definitions to better match the Printavo API response structure, including adding description field to line items and notes field to QuoteCreateInput.
- **Performance Optimizations:** The formatOrderForChat function now properly formats all order data including line items, which may increase response size but provides a better user experience.
- **UI Consistency:** We're using a blue-themed header for order cards to maintain visual consistency and highlight important information.
- **Expanding Query Capabilities:** We should consider adding support for more query types beyond visual ID, such as customer name or order status.
- **Environment Variables:** We now maintain both standard and NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefixed variables to ensure compatibility with different parts of the application.
- **Conversational UI:** The chat interface now supports multi-step workflows like quote creation with editing capabilities, which enhances the application's flexibility.
- **Homepage Behavior:** The homepage automatically redirects to the dashboard for immediate access to order information.
- **Error Handling Strategy:** We've implemented a more comprehensive error handling strategy with specific focus on API rate limiting to ensure application resilience.
- **Chart Visualization:** Used Chart.js for dashboard visualizations to provide better business insights without requiring complex backend analytics.
- **User Preferences:** Added user preference storage for display options like sort order to enhance user experience.
- **API Optimization:** Implemented staggered API requests and intelligent retry logic to minimize rate limiting issues while maintaining data freshness.
- **SmartPoller Implementation:** Redesigned the SmartPoller to properly cleanup resources and handle errors gracefully, preventing infinite loops or memory leaks.
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Improved the Jest configuration to support both unit tests and React component tests, with proper mocking of environment variables and external dependencies.
- **Error Classification:** We've implemented smart error classification to differentiate between different types of errors and provide appropriate feedback.
- **Loading State Consistency:** We're using skeleton loaders throughout the application to ensure consistent loading states and improve perceived performance.
- **Global Search Strategy:** We prioritize Visual ID matches in search results to make it easier for users to find specific orders, while still providing broader search capabilities.
- **Search Performance:** We're implementing debouncing and caching strategies to minimize API calls and improve search performance.
