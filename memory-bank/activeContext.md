# Active Context â€“ Printavo Chat Application (Updated)

## Accomplishments to Date:
- Relocated MCP servers (Printavo, SanMar, SanMar FTP) into the project directory.
- Updated the MCP settings file (`cline_mcp_settings.json`) with new server paths and added a temporary "forceReload" property to trigger a server reload.
- Successfully rebuilt the Printavo MCP server (using a manual build in its directory) to ensure that the latest tool changes are compiled.
- Diagnosed issues related to command chaining in the Windows/MINGW64 environment and adopted alternative methods to trigger builds and updates.
- Confirmed that updates to the MCP settings file can force the host system to refresh MCP servers, addressing the previous problem where new tools were not recognized after rebuilds.
- **Updated Printavo GraphQL MCP server code:** Modified `src/index.ts` by removing an extra closing brace after the "update_status" tool definition and refactored the "get_account" tool handler so that it returns proper account information instead of mistakenly including tool definitions.

## Remaining Tasks:
- **Verification:** Test and verify that the Printavo MCP server now recognizes all new tools after the forced reload.
- **Integration Testing:** Conduct comprehensive tests of the SanMar product lookup integration within the quote creation workflow.
- **MCP Server Enhancements:** Continue development by adding any missing Printavo API queries and mutations as MCP tools.
- **Robustness Improvements:** Enhance error handling, retry logic, and overall reliability across the MCP server and application APIs.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Update detailed documentation in the memory bank and perform further end-to-end testing of the Printavo chat application workflow.

## Next Steps:
- Monitor the behavior of the Printavo MCP server post-reload to ensure that tool updates are fully recognized.
- Initiate manual or automated tests to validate the integration of the SanMar and Printavo MCP servers.
- Gather feedback from further testing and refine the MCP server functionality as needed.
