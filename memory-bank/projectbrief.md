# Project Brief: Printavo Chat Application

**Objective:** Enhance the Printavo Chat application to improve its stability and add the functionality to query orders by visual ID.

**Goals:**
- **Stability Improvements:** Review the codebase to identify and fix potential stability issues, including error handling, data validation, and performance bottlenecks.
- **Query by Visual ID:** Implement a new feature that allows users to query Printavo orders using their visual IDs. This will require modifications to the API and potentially the UI.
- **Documentation:** Ensure all changes and improvements are properly documented in the memory bank.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Stable and reliable Printavo Chat application.
- Functionality to query orders by visual ID.
- Updated memory bank documentation.

**Success Metrics:**
- No crashes or errors during normal operation.
- Visual ID query feature works as expected.
- Codebase is well-documented and maintainable.

**Initial Steps:**
1. **Memory Bank Setup:** Create and populate core memory bank files.
2. **Codebase Review:** Analyze existing code for stability issues and areas for improvement.
3. **Visual ID Implementation:** Design and implement the visual ID query feature.
4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test all functionalities, including stability and visual ID query.
5. **Documentation Update:** Update memory bank with all changes and findings.
