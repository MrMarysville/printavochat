## Progress Update

### Completed Tasks
- Resolved syntax errors in `lib/graphql-client.ts` and ensured proper communication with the Printavo API.
- Fixed Printavo API connection issues:
  - Corrected the GraphQL endpoint URL to match the official documentation
  - Removed unnecessary Authorization header from requests
  - Updated GraphQL queries to use correct field names according to the actual schema
  - Fixed field name mismatches in account and order queries
  - Implemented comprehensive testing to verify the API connection works
- Implemented reliable order lookup by visual ID using the `getOrderByVisualId` function.
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application.
- Updated `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` to fetch real data from the Printavo API and removed unused variables.
- Replaced `<img>` tags with `<Image>` components in `components/file-upload.tsx` for optimized image loading.
- Fixed multiple TypeScript errors related to missing components:
  - Created Label and Select UI components
  - Added axios package for REST API client
  - Fixed file upload component's type issues
  - Fixed authentication consistency across API calls
- Added ProductsAPI implementation in printavo-api.ts to match the API documentation
- Fixed issue with Visual ID search in the chat widget:
  - Added specific pattern handling in chat/route.ts to detect 4-digit numbers in "show order" commands as Visual IDs
  - Added dedicated handler for "search orders with visual id XXXX" pattern
  - Enhanced test coverage for Visual ID search functionality
  - Fixed direct Visual ID lookup to support various formats through proper pattern matching
- Improved error handling for 404 responses when searching by Visual ID:
  - Updated all Visual ID search functions to gracefully handle 404 errors
  - Added more informative error messages for users when Visual IDs don't exist
  - Fixed discrepancies between error class property names in different files
  - Added nested try/catch blocks to properly handle errors at each level

### Current Issues
- **Type Error**: ChatMessage type is imported from `../../app/api/chat/route` but not exported from that file
- **ESLint Warning**: ProductGallery.tsx is using `<img>` tags instead of Next.js `<Image>` components

### Next Steps
1. Continue testing the API integration to ensure all queries work correctly
2. Document the correct Printavo API schema for future reference
3. Add more error handling for specific GraphQL errors
4. Fix type errors in context.ts by either:
   - Exporting ChatMessage type from chat route file, or
   - Defining the type locally in context.ts
5. Optimize ProductGallery.tsx to use Next.js Image components
6. Conduct thorough testing to verify the functionality of all implemented features.
7. Optimize performance and ensure all components are working seamlessly.

## Progress Status
All critical functionality has been properly implemented from a code perspective, and API connection issues have been resolved. 

The application can now:
1. Connect successfully to the Printavo API
2. Retrieve accurate account information
3. Query orders and other data using correct field names
4. Detect and handle Visual ID searches with proper error handling
5. Display real data in the analytics dashboard

These fixes have addressed the primary blockers that were preventing the application from functioning correctly.
