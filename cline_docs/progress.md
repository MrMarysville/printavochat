## Progress Update

### Recently Completed Tasks
- Fixed Jest configuration to work with ES modules and TypeScript:
  - Updated `jest.config.js` to use proper ESM settings
  - Added proper module extensions and transformers
  - Configured TypeScript support with ts-jest
- Improved test organization:
  - Converted manual test scripts to proper Jest test files
  - Added structured test cases for Visual ID search
  - Implemented comprehensive assertions for order data
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application:
  - Added custom error classes for different scenarios
  - Improved error messages and logging
  - Added proper error handling for API responses
- Fixed file permission issues:
  - Added `.next/trace` to `.gitignore`
  - Created `predev` script for trace directory cleanup
  - Added workaround in next.config.js

### Current Issues
- Package manager access in Git Bash environment needs to be resolved
- Need to ensure proper environment setup for running tests
- Some TypeScript type definitions need updating
- Test coverage could be improved

### Next Steps
1. Fix package manager access in the development environment:
   - Configure proper PATH settings for npm/yarn
   - Document environment setup requirements
2. Enhance test coverage:
   - Add more test cases for edge scenarios
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add error case testing
3. Update TypeScript definitions:
   - Review and update type interfaces
   - Add missing type declarations
   - Improve type safety across the codebase
4. Improve development workflow:
   - Document test running procedures
   - Add automated test running in CI/CD
   - Create development environment setup guide

## Progress Status
The application has solid foundational code and functionality in place. Recent improvements to testing infrastructure and error handling have enhanced reliability. Current focus is on improving the development environment and expanding test coverage.

The application can now:
1. Connect successfully to the Printavo API
2. Handle Visual ID searches effectively
3. Process orders and customer data
4. Manage error cases gracefully
5. Run tests in a structured way

These improvements have strengthened the codebase and improved maintainability. The next phase will focus on enhancing the development experience and expanding test coverage.
