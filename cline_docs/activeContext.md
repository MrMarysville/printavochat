# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixed the Printavo API connection issues by correcting the API endpoint configuration and GraphQL query structure.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed the GraphQL endpoint URL in `lib/printavo-api.ts` to use the correct endpoint format (`https://www.printavo.com/api/v2`)
- Removed unnecessary `Authorization` header from API requests
- Updated GraphQL queries to use correct field names according to the actual Printavo API schema
- Corrected field references in the account query from `name`/`email` to `companyName`/`companyEmail`
- Updated order queries to use `dateCreated` instead of `createdAt`
- Fixed the OrderData interface to use the correct field names
- Implemented comprehensive testing to verify API connection

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing the API integration to ensure all queries work correctly
2. Document the correct Printavo API schema for future reference
3. Add more error handling for specific GraphQL errors
4. Consider implementing a schema verification step during application startup
